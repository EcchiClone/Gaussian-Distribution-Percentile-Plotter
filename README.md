# Gaussian Distribution Percentile Plotter

This Python script was developed in collaboration with ChatGPT. It plots a Gaussian (normal) distribution given a mean value, a range, and a desired percentile. The script computes the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution such that the given range contains the desired percentile of the data.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following Python libraries:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

You can install these using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script with Python:

```
python main3.py
```

The script will plot the Gaussian distribution and highlight the area under the curve that contains the desired percentile of the data.
